"""How a call is timed: CUPTI activity collection, and the loop around it.

The timing layer owns the measurement and nothing else -- it knows how to run a callable
n times and return each run's device latency. What the numbers mean, and where they are
written, belong to the layers above.

A kernel belongs to the iteration whose external correlation id it carries, so nothing
is inferred from timestamps and a kernel shorter than the host overhead around it is
attributed as reliably as a long one. CUPTI's id stack is per-thread, which is this
protocol's one demand on a timed callable: it must launch its own work rather than hand
it to another thread (``Tensor.backward`` hands it to autograd's engine thread;
``grad_fn.apply`` does not).

    A calibration pass measures one cold-isolated iteration and the millisecond budgets

    takes its count from the clamp. L2 is cleared before every iteration, and each call
    is drained before the next begins. Each kernel is attributed to the iteration that
    launched it, so *fn* must launch its own work rather than hand it to another thread.

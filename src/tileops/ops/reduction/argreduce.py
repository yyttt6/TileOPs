    Reducing a non-last axis can be done two ways: transpose so the axis is last, which
    copies the whole tensor, or give a thread each output element and stride along the
    axis, which reads the original buffer coalesced. Which one pays off follows from the
    row count, the axis length and its stride — all three facts the kernel already holds,
    so the choice is the kernel's (`tileops.kernels.reduction.argreduce.ArgreduceKernel`).
    This op's part is the stride, which the shape and the reduced axis decide.

"""RMS norm, and the shape an op takes once its compile boundary is in the op layer.

An op that wants ``torch.compile(op, fullgraph=True)`` writes these five:

1. ``forward`` — one call to the module-level operator, nothing else. This is as far as
   dynamo traces.
2. ``_eager_forward`` — validation, kernel construction and the launch. It runs inside the
   operator, so none of it is traced.
3. ``_rms_norm_fwd`` — the operator, registered once at import time.
4. ``_rms_norm_fwd_fake`` — what the compiler is told about the output while tracing.
5. ``compile_op_names`` — the operator's name, which lets a test assert that the traced
   graph holds nothing else.

``_instance_key`` comes from the base class: ``dispatch_kernel`` assigns it during
``__init__``.

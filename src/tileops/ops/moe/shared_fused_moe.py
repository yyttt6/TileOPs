"""SharedFusedMoE — FusedMoE with shared expert support.

Combines routed experts (via FusedMoe) with shared experts (SharedExpertMLPKernel).

Usage (single GPU, tp_size=1):

        num_tokens=T, num_experts=E, top_k=K,
        hidden_size=H, ffn_size=F,

        shared_w_down=shared_w_down,         # [H, F_s]
    )

Usage (TP, tp_size>1):
    op = SharedFusedMoE(
        num_tokens=T, num_experts=E, top_k=K,
        hidden_size=H, ffn_size=F,

    """FusedMoE with shared expert support, optionally TP-aware.

    Extends FusedMoe to compute both shared and routed expert outputs.
    The shared expert is computed via SharedExpertMLPKernel (TileLang).

    TP support (shared expert only):
        When tp_size > 1, the op shards the shared expert weights internally:
          - shared_w_gate_up [2*F_s, H] is split along dim=0 (ColumnParallel)
          - shared_w_down    [H, F_s]   is split along dim=1 (RowParallel)
        The returned shared_out is a partial sum; the caller must all-reduce
        across TP ranks. The routed expert path is not affected.

    Returns:
        (shared_output, routed_output): tuple of [T, H] tensors.
            shared_output is None when shared_ffn_size is None.
            shared_output is a partial sum when tp_size > 1.

# Testing and Benchmarking

Tests and benchmarks are separated by concern: `pytest tests/` validates correctness only; `pytest benchmarks/` runs profiling only and auto-generates `profile_run.log`.

## Core Abstractions

| Class              | Location                                                             | Role                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WorkloadBase`     | [`workloads/workload_base.py`](../../workloads/workload_base.py)     | ABC defining `gen_inputs()`. Shared base used by both tests and benchmarks; a subclass named for one op also defines that op's `ref_program()`.                                     |
| `FixtureBase`      | [`workloads/workload_base.py`](../../workloads/workload_base.py)     | Metaclass-based decorator that applies `pytest.mark.parametrize` from a `PARAMS` class attribute or `get_params()` classmethod.                                                     |
| `TestBase`         | [`tests/test_base.py`](../../tests/test_base.py)                     | Inherits `WorkloadBase`. Declares `ref_program()` abstract and adds `check()`. Each op subclasses this for correctness testing.                                                     |
| `BenchmarkBase[W]` | [`benchmarks/benchmark_base.py`](../../benchmarks/benchmark_base.py) | Generic ABC parameterized by workload type `W` (a capability protocol, not `WorkloadBase`). Subclass implements `calculate_flops()` and `calculate_memory()`. Provides `profile()`. |
| `BenchmarkReport`  | [`benchmarks/benchmark_base.py`](../../benchmarks/benchmark_base.py) | Static collector -- `record()` stores results, `dump()` writes markdown, `clear()` resets.                                                                                          |

## Wiring

Workload is defined once; test and benchmark each reference it but do not depend on each other:

- **Workload** (`workloads/`) — `WorkloadBase` subclass, defines `gen_inputs()` and, when named for one op, `ref_program()`
- **Test** (`tests/ops/`) — inherits `(Workload, TestBase)`, adds tolerances; defines `ref_program()` only on a shape-only workload
- **Benchmark** (`benchmarks/ops/`) — composes workload via `BenchmarkBase(workload)`

Rules:

- **Fixture usage**: both tests and benchmarks can use `FixtureBase`, but params are usually defined per layer unless intentionally factored into a shared module
- **Dependency direction**: benchmark imports workload, never test
- **ref_program locality**: the reference lives on the narrowest shared class that names one operator — the workload, unless the workload describes only an input shape

## Tests

→ Trust boundary: [trust-model.md §Test](trust-model.md#test) | Rules: [testing-budget.md](../../.claude/domain-rules/testing-budget.md)

**Framework:** pytest. **Location:** [`tests/ops/`](../../tests/ops/).

### File checklist

1. **Workload class** in `workloads/` — subclass `WorkloadBase`, implement `gen_inputs()` and, when the class is named for one op, `ref_program()`.
1. **Fixture class** — subclass `FixtureBase`, define `PARAMS` with `smoke`/`full` marks.
1. **Test class** in `tests/ops/test_<op>.py` — inherit `(MyWorkload, TestBase)`. Implement `ref_program()` here only when the workload describes an input shape rather than an op.
1. **Test function** — `@YourFixture` decorated, call `test.check(op, *test.gen_inputs())`.

### Tolerance

- Use `torch.testing.assert_close` for floating-point verification:
  - **FP16**: `rtol=1e-3`, `atol=1e-3`
  - **BF16**: `rtol=1.6e-2`, `atol=1.6e-2`
- Use exact comparison (`torch.equal`) for non-floating outputs (bool, masks, index tensors).
- Size `atol` by the summation order, not the reduction length. Where a kernel sums differently from
  the reference (GEMV, cross-thread allreduce, split-K), cancellation puts outputs far below the
  typical magnitude and only `atol` covers their error; order-matching kernels (dense GEMM, BMM
  against cuBLAS) come out bit-exact. Measure before loosening.

### Coverage rules

- Tests must cover FP16 and BF16 data types.
- Tests must parameterize over common shapes (batch size, heads, sequence length).
- Tests must encode the dtype contract: supported dtypes are covered, unsupported dtypes are rejected, output dtypes are asserted when they differ from input.
- NPU-dependent tests must run on a real machine with host-visible Ascend devices. Sandbox-only results are not final correctness evidence.

### Test case policy

Each parameterized case must serve one of:

1. **Dtype correctness** — verify a supported dtype.
1. **Shape coverage** — verify a distinct code path (boundary, tile edge, alignment).
1. **Feature coverage** — verify a feature flag or mode (`causal=True`, `tune=True`).
1. **Regression** — reproduce a fixed bug (reference issue/PR in comment).

No performance exploration, autotune sweeps, or duplicate code-path coverage.

**Dtype coverage:** All supported dtypes must be tested. Smoke: cover each dtype with one typical shape. Full: cross-combinations only when the implementer can name the code path each guards.

**Shape coverage:** UT shapes target kernel implementation branches, not workload representativeness. Common kernel branch conditions:

- **Tile boundary** — shape not divisible by tile size (tail handling)
- **Vectorization alignment** — shape not aligned to vector width (scalar fallback)
- **Degenerate dimension** — size=1 (broadcast, squeeze paths)
- **Dispatch branch** — different shape ranges triggering different kernel variants

The implementer selects the smallest shape that triggers each branch. Do not generate test fixtures from [`src/tileops/manifest/`](../../src/tileops/manifest/) workloads.

**Growth rules:**

- Each new case must state its purpose (dtype / shape / feature / regression) in a comment or PR description.
- Over 20 cases per test function: justify which code paths require the count.
- Prefer a new test function over inflating an existing one when testing genuinely different behavior.

### Test node growth detection

[`scripts/test_node_delta.py`](../../scripts/test_node_delta.py) compares **pytest collected node count** (test cases after parametrize expansion) between current branch and main. Always exits 0 (non-blocking).

```bash
python scripts/test_node_delta.py                    # auto-detect changed test files
python scripts/test_node_delta.py tests/ops/test_foo.py  # specific files
python scripts/test_node_delta.py --base origin/release   # different base branch
```

- **No growth on existing files**: nothing to report.
- **Growth on existing files**: include script output and a one-line justification in PR description.
- **New test files only**: no delta to report — follow the policy above.

### Testing layers

| Layer             | Responsibility                                      | Shape source                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UT smoke/full     | Guard PR correctness                                | Implementer selects based on kernel code paths                   |
| Nightly benchmark | Performance regression + typical/stress correctness | [`src/tileops/manifest/`](../../src/tileops/manifest/) workloads |
| Local dev         | Performance tuning verification                     | Developer decides ad-hoc                                         |

### Infrastructure rules

- Changes to shared test infrastructure ([`tests/test_base.py`](../../tests/test_base.py), common fixtures, shared comparators) must preserve existing default semantics unless all affected tests are migrated in the same PR.
- If a PR touches shared test infrastructure, run a broader `pytest -m smoke` pass before merge.
- Run full targeted test files for the affected op family on a real NPU before claiming readiness.

## Benchmarks

→ Trust boundary: [trust-model.md §Benchmark](trust-model.md#benchmark) | Rules: [benchmark.md](../../.claude/domain-rules/benchmark.md)

**Framework:** `benchmarks.benchmark_base.BenchmarkBase`. **Location:** [`benchmarks/ops/`](../../benchmarks/ops/).

**Execution:** `pytest benchmarks/` auto-generates `profile_run.log` (markdown format).

### Workloads

Import the op's workload from `workloads/`. `BenchmarkBase[W]` is generic over
workload type and reads no attribute off it — `ManifestBenchmark` takes its
roofline from `op.eval_roofline()` — so a workload needs nothing beyond the
fields its own benchmark reads.

### File checklist

1. **Workload** — import the op's class from `workloads/`. If the op has none, add it there first: a benchmark must not author `gen_inputs`.
1. **Fixture class** — use `FixtureBase` with benchmark-specific `PARAMS`, or `pytest.mark.parametrize` directly.
1. **Benchmark class** in `benchmarks/ops/bench_<op>.py` — subclass `BenchmarkBase`, implement `calculate_flops()` and `calculate_memory()` (return `None` if not applicable).
1. **Benchmark function** — `@YourFixture` decorated, construct workload + benchmark, call `inputs = workload.gen_inputs()`, then `bm.profile(op, *inputs)` and `BenchmarkReport.record(op, locals(), result, tag="tileops")`.
1. **Independent baseline** — record at least one non-`"tileops"` baseline (e.g., `"torch"`, `"fa3"`). Profile the workload's `ref_program` for the torch baseline. Another idiom for the same computation overrides `ref_program` and says why; a different implementation takes its own tag next to it, is asserted against the reference before the case is timed, and raises when unavailable. Never import a baseline from `tests/`.
1. **Library baselines** — resolve them through [`benchmarks/baselines.py`](../../benchmarks/baselines.py): `flaggems_op`, `flashinfer_op` and `vllm_op` for the kernels the runner image must have, `compiled_reference` for the reference through inductor. Every row that has a library kernel for its op times it, so the nightly's ratio is against the strongest implementation available rather than against eager torch alone.

### Metrics

- Latency (ms)
- TFLOPS (Tera Floating-point Operations Per Second)
- DRAM Bandwidth (GB/s)

### Reporting rules

- Numbers must come from a real NPU machine, not a sandbox.
- Include small, medium, and large representative shapes.
- Do not cherry-pick favorable shapes; report regressions as-is.
- Run the targeted correctness suite on the same NPU before reporting benchmark numbers.
- `BenchmarkReport.record()` first argument may be the Op instance or a string name; stay consistent within a given benchmark file.
- `calculate_flops()` and `calculate_memory()` should return numeric values when the metric is available; return `None` only if the metric is not applicable, in which case it will be omitted from the report.
- Every benchmark must record at least one non-`"tileops"` baseline. Use existing tags (`"baseline"`, `"torch"`, `"fa3"`, `"fla"`, `"triton"`) and avoid introducing ad-hoc tags without updating downstream consumers.

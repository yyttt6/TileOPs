# Op Manifest Specification

The [`src/tileops/manifest/`](../../src/tileops/manifest/) package is the **source of truth** for op interfaces, benchmark workloads, and roofline metadata.

## Layout

One or more YAML files per family (single file by default; large families may shard). Each file is a flat top-level mapping `op_name → entry`. The `tileops.manifest` package merges all files at load; duplicate op names across files are an error.

- **Add or edit an op**: edit the family file matching the op's `family` field. Use `ruamel.yaml` for round-trip edits.
- **Read programmatically**: `from tileops.manifest import load_manifest, load_workloads, manifest_files`. `load_manifest()` returns the merged `ops` dict.
- **Read for inspection**: `yaml.safe_load` the relevant family file. No aggregate file on disk.

## Trust Model

```mermaid

    R["Authoritative reference"] -->|specified from| M["src/tileops/manifest/"]

    A -->|produces| C["Op code, tests, benchmarks"]
    M -->|validates against| V["Validator (CI)"]

```

- The manifest is written against an authoritative reference, never derived from current TileOps code.
- Ops, tests and benchmarks are generated from the manifest, not the other way round.
- **Validator** — [`scripts/validate_manifest.py`](../../scripts/validate_manifest.py) in CI. Enforces manifest ↔ code consistency.

**Invariants:**

1. The manifest is the sole source of truth for op interfaces.
1. Validation is derived from the manifest, not from the generating agent.
1. `workloads` define benchmark shapes/dtypes, not unit-test coverage.
1. `signature.params` ⊆ Op's `__init__()` + `forward()` param names. `forward()` params must match manifest inputs in order. CI enforces this.
1. Benchmarks must use declared workloads via `load_workloads`. No hardcoded shapes.

## Rules

**R1. Ordered dict.** `inputs`, `outputs`, `params` are keyed by name, and key order is signature position, so reordering is a breaking change and consumers read the file with an order-preserving parser.

**R2. Full interface.** Params include all PyTorch-supported parameters, even if the kernel only supports the default.

**R3. Param placement.** Default: `__init__` kwarg — architecture-decided and lifetime-fixed. `forward()` only when the reference API puts it there or the value is per-batch. The schema does not encode the distinction.

**R4. `dtype` syntax.** `|` separates alternatives. `same_as(ref)` is a dtype-only identity: the tensor's dtype equals `ref`'s at runtime, it adds no axis to R6's product, and it never speaks about shape.

**R5. `promote_int_to_float(ref)`.** An output dtype that resolves to `float32` when `ref`'s runtime dtype is integral and to `same_as(ref)` otherwise, for ops PyTorch promotes (`torch.reciprocal`). `ref` names a `signature.inputs` tensor. Allowed only in `signature.outputs[*].dtype`, where it may appear inside a `|` union.

Worked example — `torch.reciprocal` accepts integral inputs and returns `float32`, while floating inputs round-trip:

```yaml
ReciprocalFwdOp:
  ref_api: "torch.reciprocal"
  signature:
    inputs:
      input: {dtype: "float16 | bfloat16 | float32 | int8 | int16 | int32 | int64 | uint8"}
    outputs:
      # int8/int16/int32/int64/uint8 -> float32; float16/bfloat16/float32 unchanged.
      output: {dtype: "promote_int_to_float(input)"}
```

The op layer mirrors it: integral inputs are cast to `float32` before the float kernel runs, and `output_dtype` is `float32`. The validator expands the resolved set when it checks `_validate_dtypes` and `dtype_combos`.

**R6. `dtype_combos`.** The exhaustive list of supported cross-tensor dtype combinations. Absent means every combination of the declared unions is valid; declare it only when the supported set is a strict subset.

```yaml
dtype_combos:
  - {x: float16, weight: float16}
  - {x: float16, weight: float8_e4m3}
  - {x: bfloat16, weight: bfloat16}
```

**R7. Explicit shape.** Every output tensor's shape must be fully specified via `shape` and/or `shape_rules`. Input tensors may omit `shape` (→ arbitrary rank per R9).

**R8. `shape` = fixed rank.** Declares exact dimensions (e.g., `"[M, K]"`). One declaration: no ellipsis, no wildcards, no `|` alternatives. A tensor whose rank or axis order varies omits `shape` (R9). Roofline variable binding is defined in [roofline.md](roofline.md).

**R9. No `shape` = arbitrary rank.** Constraints go in `params` + `shape_rules`. Optionally, `static_dims` declares values the user commits to at Op construction time (R20).

**R10. No shape aliasing.** Each tensor declares its own shape. Use shared dimension names (R11) or `shape_rules` (R13) to express shape relationships.

**R11. Shared dimension names = equality.** `K` in two tensors means their sizes must match.

**R12. `constraints`.** Restricts dimensions: `"64 | 128 | 256"` (enumerated) or `"power_of_2"`, `"divisible_by(k)"`, `"even"`, `"positive"` (predicates). Requires `shape`.

**R13. `shape_rules`.** Python expressions for shape relationships. Required when `shape` alone cannot fully specify output shape.

**R14. Reduction `dim` semantics.** Live in `shape_rules`, written with the helpers in [`shape_rules.py`](../../src/tileops/manifest/shape_rules.py) — `dim_range_validity`, `dim_uniqueness`, `reduced_axes`, `reduced_shape` — which the op layer calls too, so the two cannot disagree. What an empty `dim` sequence means is per-op and named in the call.

**R15. Status gating.** `status: spec-only` → L0 only. `status: implemented` → all levels. `--check-op <name>` forces L0-L4 on the targeted entry.

**R16. Roofline metadata.** See [roofline.md](roofline.md). That document is the source of truth for roofline modes, variable binding, formula syntax, consumers, and codegen behavior.

**R17. PyTorch API alignment.** Op signatures match PyTorch's public API (names, parameter set, semantics). Do not invent parameters.

**R18. Optional tensor inputs.** A tensor input the op *reads* may declare `optional: true`, under `signature.inputs` only; params express optionality with `default`. Not passed means bound to `None`, and whether it was passed is a fact kernel dispatch may read — the tensor's contents are not. A caller-supplied output buffer (`out=`) is a param, not this. Authoring rules: [Optional Inputs](#optional-inputs).

**R18.1. Outputs are fixed per entry.** The names and the number of outputs are the same on every call. An op whose return changes with a switch is two entries, because the caller cannot unpack a return whose shape it does not know.

**R19. Tensor layout.** Default: contiguous row-major and no `layout` field. Otherwise `layout` names the order and `shape` names the axes in it. One entry, one memory order: an op serving two is two entries, since the order changes what an axis means. A param may size a dimension, never select which shape a tensor has.

**R20. `static_dims`.** For arbitrary-rank ops (no `shape` declaration), `static_dims` declares values the user commits to at Op construction time. Each entry maps an `__init__` keyword name to a single-axis shape expression `<tensor>.shape[<const_or_param>]`. See [`static_dims`](#static_dims) for full semantics, rules, and examples.

**R21. Workload keys derive from the signature.** In a single-tensor-input op's workloads, the shape key MUST be `{input}_shape` and every other key MUST be a `signature.params` name or the reserved `dtypes` / `label`. Multi-input aggregate keys (`kv_shape`) are family bench conventions, out of scope.

**R22. Mutated inputs.** A tensor input the op may write declares `mutated: true`. An operator lists its tensor arguments in `signature.inputs` order; the inputs its `mutates_args` names, across every operator the op registers, are exactly the ones marked. A mutated input stays an input: output arity does not change and the return does not alias it. If contiguity normalization had to copy one, the op writes the result back after the launch.

## `static_dims`

`static_dims` declares what becomes statically known at the moment the user constructs the Op instance. It is **per-op**, not per-family.

```yaml
static_dims:
  N: "x.shape[dim]"
```

### Semantics

The shape expression is a **forward-time validation rule**, not an init-time derivation. Two time points, one contract:

- `__init__` — **commitment point**. User-supplied value stored on `self`. Expression NOT evaluated (no tensor yet).
- `forward` — **validation point**. Expression evaluated against the actual tensor; must equal the committed value.

```python
# __init__ — commitment point. No tensor; expression not evaluated.
def __init__(self, *, N: int, dtype: torch.dtype, dim: int = -1, ...):
    self.N = N
    self.dtype = dtype
    self.dim = dim
    # ...

# forward — validation point. Expression evaluated against the actual tensor.
def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor):
    if x.shape[self.dim] != self.N:
        raise ValueError(
            f"static_dim mismatch: expected x.shape[{self.dim}] == {self.N}, "
            f"got {x.shape[self.dim]}"
        )
    # ... rest of forward
```

### Rules

- Every `static_dims` entry's key is a required `__init__` keyword parameter. **No defaults**; the user must supply every committed value at ctor.
- The expression MUST be a **single-axis reference** of the form `<tensor>.shape[<const_or_param>]`. Multi-axis forms (e.g., `product(x.shape[i] for i in ...)`, comprehensions, arithmetic over shape) are forbidden.
- Referenced tensor names must be in `signature.inputs`. Referenced axis names (when not integer literals) must be in `signature.params`.
- Key order determines the order those kwargs appear in the generated `__init__`, consistent with R1.
- `static_dims` is only for arbitrary-rank ops. Fixed-rank ops get dimensions from `shape` (R8).

### Evaluation context

Shared with `shape_rules`: all `signature.inputs` tensor names (with `.shape` accessor) and all `signature.params` names.

### Multi-input example — LinearFwdOp

The expression may reference any tensor in `signature.inputs`, not just the primary one. For `torch.nn.functional.linear(input, weight, bias)` with arbitrary-rank `input`:

```yaml
LinearFwdOp:
  signature:
    inputs:
      input:  {dtype: "float16 | bfloat16"}
      weight: {dtype: "same_as(input)"}
      bias:   {dtype: "same_as(input)"}
    outputs:
      output: {dtype: "same_as(input)"}
    static_dims:
      in_features:  "input.shape[-1]"
      out_features: "weight.shape[0]"
    shape_rules:
      - "weight.shape == (out_features, in_features)"
      - "bias.shape == (out_features,)"
      - "output.shape == input.shape[:-1] + (out_features,)"
```

`out_features` is intrinsically a property of `weight`, not `input` — there is no equivalent expression in terms of `input.shape`. Binding to `weight.shape[0]` is the only faithful declaration.

### Generated `__init__` kwarg block order

Three blocks in order:

1. `static_dims` — manifest key order
1. `dtype` — single parameter unless the op has explicit multi-dtype axes
1. `params` — manifest key order

Parameters are positional-or-keyword in that order. A param the caller must name declares `kw_only: true`, and the validator holds `__init__` to it. `target` and `tune` are keyword-only in every op and are not manifest params.

### Empty `static_dims`

Empty (`static_dims: {}` or absent) is legal. Typical case: PyTorch-aligned reductions that accept `dim=None`, where the reduction extent depends on the entire input shape and is not a user-provided hyperparameter:

```yaml
SumFwdOp:
  signature:
    inputs:  {x: {dtype: "..."}}
    outputs: {y: {dtype: "same_as(x)"}}
    params:
      dim:     {type: "int | list[int] | tuple[int, ...] | None", default: null}
      keepdim: {type: bool, default: false}
    # static_dims absent — equivalent to static_dims: {}
    shape_rules: [...]
```

The generated `__init__` has no shape kwargs:

```python
def __init__(self, *, dtype, dim=None, keepdim=False, ...):
    # ...
```

**When `static_dims` is empty, the Op author MUST override `_cache_key`.** The default falls back to the full input shape tuple — correct but pathological under dynamic shapes (every distinct input shape recompiles). Typical full-reduce override:

```python
class SumFwdOp(Op):
    def _cache_key(self, x_shape):
        return (
            math.prod(x_shape),
        )  # all full-reductions with same numel share a kernel
```

The base class emits a once-per-type runtime warning when the default `_cache_key` is invoked with empty `static_dims` and no subclass override. See [ops-design-reference.md § `_cache_key` override](ops-design-reference.md#optional-hooks-appendix).

## Manifest Key Format

Each top-level entry is keyed by the **Python class name** of the Op — PascalCase with an `Op` suffix and an optional direction suffix:

```
{PascalCaseName}[{Direction}]Op
```

- **PascalCaseName** — descriptive name in PascalCase (`RMSNorm`, `BatchNorm`, `Softmax`). Author chooses; no abbreviation rules. A qualifier is part of this name and always precedes `{Direction}Op` (`MaxPool2dIndicesFwdOp`, never `MaxPool2dFwdOpIndices`).
- **Direction** — `Fwd` or `Bwd`. REQUIRED when the manifest carries both directions of the same op (a direction sibling exists); single-direction ops MAY omit it.
- **Op** — literal suffix.

Examples: `RMSNormFwdOp`, `BatchNormFwdOp`, `SoftmaxFwdOp`, `DropoutFwdOp`.

Validator enforces `cls.__name__ == manifest_key` exactly — no heuristic resolution or case conversion.

## Entry Structure

| Field                     | Required | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `family`                  | yes      | Op family. See [below](#family).                              |
| `ref_api`                 | yes      | External API reference, or `"none"` if no direct counterpart. |
| `status`                  | yes      | `spec-only` or `implemented`.                                 |
| `torch_compile_fullgraph` | no       | Literal `true` only. See [below](#torch_compile_fullgraph).   |
| `signature`               | yes      | Op interface. See [Signature](#signature).                    |
| `workloads`               | yes      | Benchmark shapes/dtypes.                                      |
| `roofline`                | yes      | Performance model.                                            |
| `source`                  | yes      | Implementation paths.                                         |

### `family`

Lowercase snake_case family name. Determines which family file owns the entry (see [Layout](#layout)). Introducing a new family means adding a new family file — human-reviewed like any manifest change. The validator checks presence only.

### `torch_compile_fullgraph`

Optional; literal `true` only. Omit for "no promise" — `false` is invalid. Invalid on `status: spec-only`.

`true` declares: for each manifest-supported configuration, the first call through `torch.compile(op, fullgraph=True)` succeeds with no prior eager call and is correct under the op's tolerance policy. Not promised: dynamic shapes, `dynamic=True`, absence of recompilation. Warm-up-dependent capture does not qualify.

Every declared op MUST have a compile test registered in `tests/compile_contract.py`; CI holds declarations and registered evidence in exact set equality.

### `ref_api`

Fully qualified external API name (typically PyTorch), or `"none"`. Informational — validator checks presence only.

```yaml
RMSNormFwdOp:
  ref_api: "torch.nn.functional.rms_norm"
NSAFwdOp:
  ref_api: "none"
```

### Signature

```yaml
signature:
  inputs:       # tensor name → {dtype, shape?, constraints?}
  outputs:      # tensor name → {dtype, shape?, constraints?}
  params:       # param name → {type, default?}
  static_dims:  # kwarg → "<tensor>.shape[<axis>]" — arbitrary-rank only (R20)
  shape_rules:  # Python expressions for shape inference
  dtype_combos: # valid cross-tensor dtype combinations
```

**Tensor fields:**

| Field         | Required | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dtype`       | yes      | `\|` for alternatives, `same_as(ref)` = same dtype as ref, `promote_int_to_float(ref)` = `float32` for integral ref else `same_as(ref)`. |
| `shape`       | no       | Dimension names (e.g., `"[M, K]"`). Present = fixed rank.                                                                                |
| `constraints` | no       | Dimension restrictions (requires `shape`).                                                                                               |
| `layout`      | no       | Memory format when non-default (R19).                                                                                                    |
| `optional`    | no       | `true` when the op may be called without this input (R18). Inputs only.                                                                  |
| `mutated`     | no       | `true` when the op may write this input (R22). Inputs only.                                                                              |

**Param fields:** `type`, plus optional `default` and `kw_only`.
A param that omits `default` MUST have no `__init__` default either: a
constructor that accepts a placeholder and rejects it later states a contract
the signature does not.

`type` is a Python type expression: `int`, `float | None`, `torch.dtype`.

The declared type and the implementation's annotation must agree on one point — whether
`None` is admitted. Spelling stays the author's: `Number` and `bool | int | float` name one
domain. `None` is the exception because admitting it decides whether a caller may withhold
the value. A type that does not admit `None` may not carry `default: null`.

#### Shape Decision Tree

```
Fixed rank, expressible with dimension names?
├─ YES → shape: "[D1, D2, ...]"                           [R8]
│   Relationships beyond shared names?
│   └─ YES → add shape_rules                              [R13]
└─ NO (arbitrary rank)
   ├─ write shape_rules                                   [R13]
   └─ Values committed at Op construction time?
      └─ YES → add static_dims                            [R20]
```

#### Optional Inputs

A tensor input the op reads may be optional (R18). One entry then covers passing it and
omitting it. Optional inputs are the trailing inputs: `forward` takes each with a `None`
default in the declared order, and a defaulted parameter cannot precede a required one.

```yaml
signature:
  inputs:
    x:      {dtype: "float32 | float16 | bfloat16"}
    weight: {dtype: "same_as(x)", optional: true}
    bias:   {dtype: "same_as(x)", optional: true}
  shape_rules:
  - "(weight is None) == (bias is None)"                # one switch, two tensors
  - "weight is None or weight.shape == (x.shape[1],)"   # guard precedes the use
  - "bias is None or bias.shape == (x.shape[1],)"
workloads:
- {label: image-g32, x_shape: [8, 128, 32, 32], num_groups: 32, dtypes: [float16]}
- {label: image-g32-affine, x_shape: [8, 128, 32, 32], num_groups: 32,
   dtypes: [float16], weight_shape: [128], bias_shape: [128]}
```

Optional inputs that share one switch state that relation in `shape_rules`, as the first
rule above does. The rules are ordinary conjuncts — no new field, no separate list.

The op branches on whether an argument was supplied — which kernel it builds, which
buffers it allocates. It does not branch on what the argument contains: that would be a
device read at dispatch time, and the fact read is not in the signature. A fact that
selects a kernel is a `params` entry.

**Where the name may appear.** In three places: `X`'s own `dtype` / `shape` declaration; a
bare presence test `X is None` / `X is not None`; and a use already guarded by `X is None`
earlier in the same expression. Every other position states something that must hold on
every call, and absence is not a value — it is the name having no referent — so an
unconditional declaration that depends on it means nothing on the call that omits it.

| position                             | rule                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shape_rules`                        | every occurrence of `X` that is not itself a presence test needs a disjunct `X is None` among the leading operands of the rule's top-level `or` |
| `roofline` `vars`                    | `X` may appear only as `X is None` or `X is not None`; `X.shape`, `X.ndim`, `X[...]` are rejected even under a guard                            |
| `roofline` `flops` / `bytes`         | no `X` at all — the arithmetic layer reads `vars`, params and `elem_bytes`, so a presence test reaches it through a `vars` entry                |
| `dtype_combos` row                   | no column keyed by `X` — a row assigns a dtype on every call it covers, and an absent input has none                                            |
| any `dtype` expression               | `same_as(X)` is rejected — an absent input has no dtype to resolve to                                                                           |
| required input's or output's `shape` | may not use a symbol first bound in `X`'s `shape`                                                                                               |

The guard is `X is None or <condition>`, never `X is not None and <condition>`:
`shape_rules` entries are conjuncts, so the second form reports a legal absent call as a
violation. It must precede the use but need not sit leftmost —
`min is None or max is None or output.shape == broadcast_shapes(input.shape, min.shape, max.shape)`
is well formed. A formula that needs an optional tensor's own shape uses
`roofline: {func: ...}`, where the function sees the actual call.

**Workload coverage.** Every optional input needs at least one row that passes it and at
least one that omits it, counted per input rather than per combination: n optional inputs
are 2n states, not 2ⁿ. A row passes `X` by carrying `<X>_shape`, whatever else it writes —
a row is sample call data, not a contract expression, so the position rules above do not
reach it. `status: spec-only` entries are exempt (R15 runs them at L0 only).

Coverage reaches optional inputs and nothing else. Which value a param takes is benchmark
completeness, tracked on its own; which shape range picks which kernel is a branch only the
kernel knows, and [testing.md](testing.md) already makes the op author cover it with the
smallest shape that triggers each branch.

**Roofline describes the call that ran.** A formula whose cost varies with an optional
input reads that input's presence — inline through a `vars` presence test, or `func` mode,
which sees the call. "Everything passed" is not an upper bound to fall back on. How much of
a call's traffic a formula models at all is [roofline.md](roofline.md)'s matter.

**What the validator does not check.** Five things, deliberately:

- It does not solve `shape_rules` for the set of legal ways to call the op.
- It does not sort rules into presence rules and shape rules; both kinds may reference shapes, params and whitelisted helpers.
- It does not enumerate the 2ⁿ ways to pass n optional inputs.
- It does not ask the manifest for a field declaring which optional inputs go together; `(weight is None) == (bias is None)` stays an ordinary `shape_rules` string.
- It does not stop a call that passes half of a co-occurring group. The op's own check in `forward` does, the same way every other shape constraint is caught, and the error names which group was given in part.

What runtime can never report — a contract position no workload row covers — is what the
coverage rule checks statically.

**What stays separate.** `optional: true` does not merge everything. Three shapes keep
their own entries: an op whose outputs change with a switch (R18.1), an op that puts the
same concept in `params` in one form and in `inputs` in another (`LerpFwdOp` versus
`LerpTensorFwdOp`), and one signature served by genuinely different algorithms (the `Rope*`
family), which produce different values from the same inputs and so carry a `ref_api` and a
roofline each. There is no field linking them: each writes the same `source.op`, which is
where a reader sees they come from one implementation.

### Workloads

Shape keys use `<tensor_name>_shape`. Op-specific parameters can be added per entry.

```yaml
- {x_shape: [2048, 4096], dtypes: [float16, bfloat16], label: "llama-8b"}
```

`workloads` are for benchmark parametrization only, not unit-test coverage.

### Roofline

Roofline metadata is required on every manifest entry. Its modes,
variable binding rules, formula syntax, consumers, and codegen behavior
are defined in [roofline.md](roofline.md).

### Source

| Field                   | Required | Description                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kernel`                | yes      | Path(s) to the backend module holding the builder, or `null` when no backend registers one. |
| `op`                    | yes      | Op class file path.                                                    |
| `test`                  | yes      | Test file path.                                                        |
| `bench`                 | yes      | Benchmark file path.                                                   |
| `bench_manifest_driven` | \*       | Required `true` when `status: implemented`; makes L4 a hard CI error.  |

#### kernel

Where the kernel that runs this op lives. Kernels ship in backend distributions, not in this
one, so the path is repo-relative (`op` stays distribution-relative — it ships in the same
wheel as the manifest). An op no backend registers a builder for gets `kernel: null` and the
reason on the line above: naming a path that does not exist would be worse than saying so.

```yaml
source:
  kernel: src/tileops/kernels/families/two_pass.py
  op: tileops/ops/norm/rms_norm.py

# An op with no kernel on this hardware
source:
  # No Ascend kernel: no backend registers a builder for this op.
  kernel: null
  op: tileops/ops/gemm/gemm.py
```

There is no dispatch table. Which of its kernels a target runs is decided inside its
`build_kernel`, where the shapes and dtypes are; the manifest names the op, and the op
names the computation.

## Entry Examples

**Fixed rank — GEMM** \[R8, R11\]:

```yaml
inputs:
  a: {dtype: "float16 | bfloat16", shape: "[M, K]"}
  b: {dtype: "same_as(a)", shape: "[K, N]"}
outputs:
  c: {dtype: "same_as(a)", shape: "[M, N]"}
```

**Fixed rank + constraints — FFT** \[R8, R12\]:

```yaml
inputs:
  x: {dtype: "complex64", shape: "[M, N]", constraints: {N: "power_of_2"}}
outputs:
  y: {dtype: "same_as(x)", shape: "[M, N]"}
```

**Arbitrary rank — RMSNorm** \[R9, R13, R17\]:

```yaml
inputs:
  x: {dtype: "float16 | bfloat16"}
  weight: {dtype: "same_as(x)"}
outputs:
  output: {dtype: "same_as(x)"}
params:
  normalized_shape: {type: "list[int] | tuple[int, ...]"}
  eps: {type: "float | None", default: null}
shape_rules:
  - "len(normalized_shape) > 0"
  - "tuple(x.shape[-len(normalized_shape):]) == tuple(normalized_shape)"
  - "weight.shape == tuple(normalized_shape)"
  - "output.shape == x.shape"
```

**Arbitrary rank — Reduce** \[R9, R13\]:

```yaml
inputs:
  x: {dtype: "float16 | bfloat16 | float32"}
outputs:
  output: {dtype: "same_as(x)"}
params:
  dim: {type: "int | list[int] | tuple[int, ...] | None", default: null}
  keepdim: {type: bool, default: false}
shape_rules:
  - "dim is None or all(-x.ndim <= d < x.ndim for d in ([dim] if isinstance(dim, int) else dim))"
  - "isinstance(dim, (int, type(None))) or len({d % x.ndim for d in dim}) == len(dim)"
  - "output.shape == reduced_shape(x.shape, dim, keepdim)"
```

All reduction ops include `dim` + `keepdim`. **Exception:** softmax/log_softmax preserve the input shape and take no `keepdim`; count_nonzero has no `keepdim` either (R17). What an empty `dim` sequence means is per-op: see R14 and [domain-rules/manifest-spec.md](../../.claude/domain-rules/manifest-spec.md).

**Full entry — RMSNorm:**

```yaml
RMSNormFwdOp:
  family: normalization
  ref_api: "torch.nn.functional.rms_norm"
  status: implemented

  signature:
    inputs:
      x: {dtype: "float16 | bfloat16"}
      weight: {dtype: "same_as(x)"}
    outputs:
      output: {dtype: "same_as(x)"}
    params:
      normalized_shape: {type: "list[int] | tuple[int, ...]"}
      eps: {type: "float | None", default: null}
    shape_rules:
      - "len(normalized_shape) > 0"
      - "tuple(x.shape[-len(normalized_shape):]) == tuple(normalized_shape)"
      - "weight.shape == tuple(normalized_shape)"
      - "output.shape == x.shape"

  workloads:
    - {x_shape: [2048, 4096], normalized_shape: [4096], dtypes: [float16, bfloat16], label: "llama-8b-prefill"}
    - {x_shape: [1, 4096], normalized_shape: [4096], dtypes: [bfloat16], label: "llama-8b-decode"}

  roofline:
    vars:
      M: "product(x.shape[:x.ndim - len(normalized_shape)])"
      N: "product(normalized_shape)"
    flops: "4 * M * N"
    bytes: "(2 * M * N + N) * elem_bytes"

  source:
    kernel: src/tileops/kernels/families/two_pass.py
    op: tileops/ops/norm/rms_norm.py
    test: tests/ops/test_rms_norm.py
    bench: benchmarks/ops/bench_norm.py
```

## Benchmark Pattern

Benchmarks must use manifest-driven workloads. See [testing.md](testing.md)
for benchmark structure and [roofline.md](roofline.md) for roofline
consumption.

### Workload entry schema

Each entry under `workloads:` is a mapping. `dtypes` and `label` are
reserved. Key rules: R21.

| Key             | Required | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{input}_shape` | yes\*    | Shape for the single tensor input (list of ints), named per R21. \*Multi-input families define their own aggregate shape keys (e.g. `q_shape`/`kv_shape`) in their family bench files.                |
| `dtypes`        | yes      | List of dtype strings (`["float16", "bfloat16"]`).                                                                                                                                                    |
| `label`         | no       | Human-readable id used in the pytest param id and report tables. MUST NOT name a dtype the row's `dtypes` already lists: the case id ends with the dtype it runs, so the label would render it twice. |
| *any other key* | no       | Op param value (`dim`, `keepdim`, …). MUST be a declared `signature.params` name (R21); overrides its default.                                                                                        |

Example — parametrizing a reduction workload over a non-last `dim`:

```yaml
workloads:
  - {x_shape: [2048, 4096], dtypes: [bfloat16], dim: -1, label: "reduce-last"}
  - {x_shape: [2048, 4096], dtypes: [bfloat16], dim:  0, label: "reduce-first"}
```

## Manifest Validation

[`scripts/validate_manifest.py`](../../scripts/validate_manifest.py) runs five levels:

| Level | Check     | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ----- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| L0    | Schema    | Required fields exist, correct types                                                                                        |
| L1    | Signature | Params ⊆ `__init__()` ∪ `forward()` names; `forward()` order matches                                                        |
| L2    | Shape     | `shape_rules` are valid Python expressions                                                                                  |
| L3    | Dtype     | dtype strings are valid torch types, `same_as()` refs, or `promote_int_to_float()` refs                                     |
| L4    | Benchmark | Bench file imports/calls `load_workloads` and `eval_roofline` (directly or via `workloads_to_params` / `ManifestBenchmark`) |

`spec-only` ops → L0 only. `implemented` ops → all levels. `--check-op <name>` forces L0-L4 on the targeted entry. L2 and L3 additionally run parity extensions against the implemented Op's `_infer_output_shapes` / `_validate_dtypes` methods; see [ops-design.md](ops-design.md).

```bash
python scripts/validate_manifest.py
python scripts/validate_manifest.py --check-op SoftmaxFwdOp
```

## Exclusions

The manifest does NOT describe: multi-kernel execution ordering, accumulator dtypes, persistent state, tile sizes, or autotuning config.

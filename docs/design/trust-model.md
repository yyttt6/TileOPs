# Layering

Where each kind of content lives, and the couplings that would defeat that.
Each boundary below exists because crossing it produced duplication, drift, or
a false guarantee.

## Manifest

Source of truth for op interfaces: signatures, dtypes, workload shapes,
roofline formulas, status, the `source` paths, and
user-visible capability declarations (`torch_compile_fullgraph`).

It carries no kernel internals, dispatch strategy, or test logic. Those are
implementation choices; freezing one into the spec makes every later
implementation conform to an accident.

→ Rules: [manifest-spec.md](../../.claude/domain-rules/manifest-spec.md) | Guide: [manifest.md](manifest.md)

## Test

Tolerances and assertions live with the test, which does not import from
[`benchmarks/`](../../benchmarks/).

Input construction does not, and neither does the reference computation of an
op that has a workload named for it: both belong in
[`workloads/`](../../workloads/). Anything left inside `tests/` is unreachable
from a benchmark — see [§Benchmark](#benchmark) — so it gets copied, and the
two copies drift.

## Implementation

PyTorch is the spec oracle, not a runtime path. The Op layer produces results
through TileLang kernels or tensor primitives; delegating to a higher-level
PyTorch operator (`torch.sum`, `F.softmax`, …) at forward time is forbidden —
it would make the library measure and ship PyTorch. Narrow fallback exceptions
are listed in [ops-design.md](../../.claude/domain-rules/ops-design.md).

## Benchmark

A benchmark does not import from [`tests/`](../../tests/). It reads the
op's reference from [`workloads/`](../../workloads/) — the same definition the
test checks against — and times it as the torch baseline.

The `tests/` boundary buys decoupling: nightly benchmarks keep running across
test-side refactors, and a tolerance or comparator change cannot move a
baseline number. Sharing the reference costs none of that, and removes the
second copy that used to drift.

A baseline that is another idiom for the same computation overrides
`ref_program` in the benchmark and says why.

A baseline that is a different implementation is timed under its own tag next
to the reference: the tag is what names it in the report, so it is checked
against the reference before the case is timed.

[`benchmarks/tests/test_benchmark_boundaries.py`](../../benchmarks/tests/test_benchmark_boundaries.py)
checks the `tests/` import and a locally defined `gen_inputs`, both by literal
name.

## Workloads layer

The shared layer, and the only one both tests and benchmarks import.

**Provides**: `WorkloadBase` (`gen_inputs`), `FixtureMeta` / `FixtureBase`
(parametrize), and one workload class per op — or one parameterized class a
family shares.

**Must contain**: input construction for every op, and — where the class is
named for an op — that op's reference computation.

**Must not contain**: tolerances, `check`, `calculate_flops` /
`calculate_memory`, or the choice of what to time against. Those are decisions,
the first three the test's and the last the benchmark's, and a decision placed
here reaches the other consumer.

The reference computation is not a decision. It is the executable form of the
manifest's `ref_api`: what the operator means, the same for whoever asks.
Assigning it to one consumer obliges the other to keep a second copy, and two
copies of the same math drift apart in silence — the benchmark then reports a
ratio against a computation no test validated.

It belongs to the narrowest shared class that names one operator. That is
normally the workload; a workload describing only an input shape — one random
tensor, a matching pair — is reused across ops, names none of them, and so its
consumers carry the reference instead. `TestBase` already declares
`ref_program` abstract, so whichever class supplies it, a test without one
cannot be instantiated.

```
WorkloadBase (workloads/workload_base.py)  # gen_inputs(), and ref_program()
  |                                        # on the classes named for an op
  ├── TestBase (tests/test_base.py)        # adds check() and tolerances
  └── concrete subclasses per op

BenchmarkBase[W] (benchmarks/)             # generic over workload type; reads
                                           # roofline off the op, not the workload
```

# Roofline

This document describes the `roofline` field in `src/tileops/manifest/`: what it is, how to author one, and who consumes it.

## 1. Performance Model

### 1.1 Baseline Selection

Kernel performance is measured against hardware Speed-of-Light (SOL), not against PyTorch or vendor baselines. The `roofline` field supplies the per-op inputs this model needs (§2).

### 1.2 Metric Definition

```
memory_time  = bytes_moved / hbm_bandwidth
compute_time = total_flops / peak_flops
sol_time     = max(memory_time, compute_time)
efficiency   = sol_time / actual_time
```

Inputs:

- `bytes_moved`, `total_flops` — manifest `roofline` (§2).
- `hbm_bandwidth` — device profile (§5.1), `hbm` section, effective value.
- `peak_flops` — device profile section named by `op.compute_roof()` (§1.4), effective value.
- `actual_time` — benchmark output (§5.2): device-busy time plus any device copies excluded from it (`uncounted_copy_ms`).

Bound type is whichever term dominates `sol_time` (memory-bound if `memory_time > compute_time`, else compute-bound). It depends on shape, not on the op; the roofline tool computes it per-workload and the manifest does not declare it.

The metric is **algorithmic** SOL efficiency. Three statements delimit what a reading means:

1. `bytes_moved` is the algorithm's minimum traffic (each input read once, each output written once), not measured DRAM traffic.
1. `total_flops` follows the §1.3 counting convention, not per-instruction hardware cost; the metric does not certify an SFU-bound kernel as at its limit.
1. The compute roof is the unit an optimal implementation would use (§1.4), not the unit the current kernel runs on.

Rows the model cannot price honestly are handled three ways:

- **Blank, never guessed** — timed without device activity, `bytes` formula yields zero, or no device profile matches the device.
- **Labeled latency-bound** — `sol_time` and measured time both below the latency floor: launch overhead dominates and the model has no traction; regression detection still covers the row.
- **Reported as a formula error, never as a fast kernel** — the row implies a rate above a *theoretical* ceiling.

### 1.3 Convention

Per-element FLOP rule for elementwise ops:

- One basic arithmetic op (add, sub, mul, div, neg, abs, recip) counts as 1 FLOP.
- One transcendental call (`exp`, `log`, `log1p`, `erf`, `tanh`, `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, `rsqrt`, etc.) counts as 1 FLOP at the convention level. Hardware-specific cost models do not feed back into the manifest.
- One compare-and-select (`max`, `min`, `maximum`, `minimum`, single- or two-bound clamp, `relu`-style branch, `where`) counts as 1 FLOP per output element.
- Predicate-only outputs (`eq`, `gt`, etc.) count as 1 FLOP per element.

Composite ops sum their primitives — `sigmoid = neg + exp + add + recip = 4` FLOPs/elem; `silu = sigmoid + mul = 5` FLOPs/elem.

### 1.4 Compute Roof

`Op.compute_roof()` returns the NPU-profile key (§5.1) of the unit that prices the op's FLOPs — `"vector.fp32"`, `"cube.bf16"`, `"cube.fp16"`, …. The two unit names are the 910B1 AI Core's own: matrix contractions run on its **Cube** unit, everything else on its **Vector** unit.

- The key states the unit an **optimal** implementation would use, declared by the op author in code. It is never inferred from the running kernel — that would price a kernel on the wrong unit against the wrong ceiling and hide exactly the gap the metric exists to expose. Nor from the input dtype alone — an fp8-backend attention takes fp16/bf16 tensors.
- The `Op` base defaults to `"vector.fp32"`, which covers every op whose arithmetic runs on the Vector unit in fp32 (elementwise, reductions, norms, scans). An op whose FLOPs are matmul contractions overrides it, normally with `cube_roof(self.dtype)`; one whose unit depends on instance state (a backend switch, a quantized path) branches on that state.
- There is no `cube.fp8`. 910B1's Cube unit stops at 16 bits, so an FP8 request is a storage format the op dequantizes and contracts in fp16 — soft-FP8, priced at `cube.fp16`. `cube_roof()` raises on an fp8 dtype rather than quoting a ceiling the hardware does not have; the two ops that take an FP8 path return `"cube.fp16"` directly and say why at the return.
- The declaration is valid whenever `eval_roofline()` is — after the op's dtype is bound.
- A wrong or missing override is caught by the nightly physics check (§4.3): a Cube-unit kernel priced against the Vector-unit ceiling implies a FLOP rate above that ceiling's theoretical value, reported as a formula error on the next run.

## 2. Field Specification

### 2.1 Output Contract

Per workload, the `roofline` field yields `(flops: int, bytes: int)`. Consumers read these integers via `op.eval_roofline()` on an instantiated Op (§4.4). The compute roof is not part of the manifest field; the op declares it in code (§1.4).

### 2.2 Formula Modes

An entry uses one of two modes:

| Mode   | Form                      | When                              |
| ------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Inline | `vars?` + `flops`/`bytes` | Formula fits a Python expression. |
| Func   | `func: "module.path"`     | Formula needs real Python logic.  |

**Inline.** Roofline variables come from `shape` dim names where possible. Anything `shape` cannot supply — arbitrary-rank dims, slice products, shape-derived quantities — is declared in `vars`. `flops` and `bytes` are Python expressions over all resolved variables + `elem_bytes` + approved helpers (§4.4.4). `elem_bytes` is the byte size of the first input's dtype. **Ops whose `bytes` depend on multiple input dtypes (mixed-precision GEMM, Attention, etc.) cannot be expressed in inline mode** and must use `func`.

**Func.** Point at `tileops.perf.formulas.<name>`. The callable is human-authored and returns `(flops, bytes)`. **Recommended signature: `func(op)`** — matching the agent-generated `eval_roofline(self)` path, which is what codegen's emitted call assumes. A human author who prefers a different signature owns the resulting integration (e.g., a wrapper). Use `func` when inline arithmetic is insufficient (mixed-precision byte accounting, conditionals, shape traversal, data-dependent logic).

```yaml
# Inline — shape dim names cover all variables
roofline:
  flops: "2 * M * N * K"
  bytes: "(M * K + K * N + M * N) * elem_bytes"

# Inline — shape cannot supply the variables; vars fills in
roofline:
  vars:
    M: "product(x.shape[:dim])"
    N: "x.shape[dim]"
  flops: "4 * M * N"
  bytes: "(2 * M * N + N) * elem_bytes"

# Func — complex formulas
roofline:
  func: "tileops.perf.formulas.my_op_roofline"
```

## 3. Consumers

`src/tileops/manifest/` is the source of truth for the `roofline` field. Four modules read it:

- **Schema validator / CI** — structural checks only (schema, mode exclusivity, `func` importability). Does **not** execute formulas or hold a helper whitelist. Spec: §4.1.
- **Benchmark layer** — instantiates an Op per workload and reads `(flops, bytes)` from `op.eval_roofline()`. Hardcoded formulas in benchmark files are a CI failure. Spec: §4.2.
- **Roofline tool (M5)** — reads per-workload `(flops, bytes)`, the roof key, and timing from benchmark output, prices them against the device profile (§5.1), and emits SOL efficiency and verdicts. Spec: §4.3.
- **Op codegen** — generates each op's `eval_roofline()` method; is the authoritative gate for name and form correctness. Spec: §4.4.

Two auditors check the field's values rather than consume them: the structural oracle (§4.6) and the NCU bytes audit (§4.5).

Tests and workloads are not consumers: they may supply shapes and dtypes but must not define or reinterpret roofline formulas.

## 4. Consumer Specifications

### 4.1 Schema Validator / CI

Runs on every PR touching `src/tileops/manifest/`. Scope is structural.

Every roofline entry MUST satisfy:

- Required fields per mode: inline has `flops` and `bytes`; func has `func`.
- Mode exclusivity: `flops`/`bytes`/`vars` and `func` do not coexist.
- Field types: `flops`/`bytes`/`func` are non-empty strings; `vars` is a mapping of str → non-empty str.
- `func` dotted path resolves at import time.

Out of the validator's scope:

- Name whitelist — a formula's names are checked by codegen (§4.4), which owns the binding table. Validator does not mirror it.
- Form checks (layer violations, forbidden AST nodes) — codegen refuses to emit invalid forms.
- Numeric checks (finite / non-negative / numeric) — tests exercise generated `eval_roofline()` on each workload.

Validator holds no callables, no sample bindings, no `__builtins__` sandbox. Adding a helper does not touch the validator.

### 4.2 Benchmark Layer

Contract:

- Instantiate the Op for each workload and call `op.eval_roofline()` to obtain `(flops, bytes)`. No manifest-level helper exists — roofline evaluation lives only inside each Op's generated method.
- `ManifestBenchmark` and `workloads_to_params(..., include_extra=True)` are the canonical consumers; non-reserved workload keys forward as op-call params passed to the Op's `__init__`.
- A benchmark file that computes FLOPs or bytes locally is a CI failure.
- Benchmark output must record the `(flops, bytes)` from `op.eval_roofline()` and the roof key from `op.compute_roof()` (§1.4), so M5 reads the numbers without re-instantiating ops.

### 4.3 Roofline Tool (M5)

Inputs:

- Benchmark output produced by M4, carrying per-workload timing, the `(flops, bytes)` from `op.eval_roofline()`, and the roof key from `op.compute_roof()`.
- device profile (§5.1), selected by matching the profile's `npu` field against the measured device name; no match leaves every SOL reading blank.

Per-workload outputs: SOL efficiency, bound type, latency-bound labels, anomaly reports.

Does not interpret formula strings at all. M5 reads pre-computed numbers from the benchmark output; it never instantiates Ops or runs roofline expressions.

Verdict lines are rendering thresholds, not CI gates:

| Verdict    | Condition | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| At ceiling | ≥ 80%     | Done. The HBM ceiling is an envelope over access mixes, and a kernel's own mix caps below it (a perfect 2R:1W kernel reaches ~90% of it, a perfect 1R:1W ~87%); the line sits below every mix's personal ceiling. |
| Anomaly    | > 105%    | Above the achievable ceiling: the formula or the calibration is wrong. Excluded from "at ceiling".                                                                                                                |

Physics check: every row's implied rates (`bytes / time`, `flops / time`) are compared against the *theoretical* ceilings of its roofs. A breach is physically impossible, so it is reported as a formula error that fails the run's health — a formula edit that inflates work is caught on the next nightly. This check is the standing guard on formula overestimation; equality-level validation belongs to the structural oracle (§4.6), hardware-counter validation to the bytes audit (§4.5).

### 4.4 Op Codegen

Codegen runs for `status: implemented` entries only. `spec-only` entries — where either the implementation does not exist or the Op interface does not yet match the manifest — are skipped; codegen re-evaluates them once the status flips.

Codegen is the authoritative gate for name and form correctness. A formula referencing an unknown name or violating a layer's form constraints fails codegen; a manifest that fails codegen cannot land. Numeric correctness is exercised by tests, not codegen.

#### 4.4.1 Method Template

For each op, codegen emits an `eval_roofline()` method returning `(flops: int, bytes: int)`. The method signature is part of the shared Op interface defined in [ops-design-reference.md](ops-design-reference.md); this document specifies only how the body is generated from the manifest.

```python
def eval_roofline(self) -> tuple[int, int]:
    M = self.M
    N = self.N
    elem_bytes = self.dtype.itemsize
    return (
        4 * M * N,
        (2 * M * N + N) * elem_bytes,
    )
```

#### 4.4.2 Manifest Inputs

For each manifest entry, codegen reads one of:

- **Inline** — `vars` (optional), `flops`, `bytes`. All are Python expression source strings. Codegen emits the method body per §4.4.3.
- **Func** — `func` (dotted module path resolving to a human-authored callable). Codegen emits `return <func>(self)` as the method body. This presumes the **recommended** signature `func(op) -> tuple[int, int]` (returning `(flops, bytes)`), aligned with the agent-generated `eval_roofline(self)` shape. The recommendation is not a gate: codegen does not introspect the callable, and an author choosing another signature owns making it work with the emitted call (e.g. a thin wrapper at the dotted path).

#### 4.4.3 Expression Layers

Inline mode has two layers. Codegen emits them as two sequential blocks in the method body.

- **vars layer** — shape-derived resolution. Allowed operations: tensor shape access, slicing, `product()`, `range()`, small comprehensions.
- **arithmetic layer** — `flops` and `bytes` over resolved variables + `elem_bytes` + approved helpers only. Forbidden: tensor access, shape slicing, comprehensions, attributes, arbitrary calls.

**Block 1 — vars resolution.**

- Bind each `signature.inputs` tensor and `signature.params` name *referenced by the roofline expressions* to a local. Names declared in the manifest but unused by the roofline are not bound; ops are not required to expose them. Op-author conventions for exposing referenced names on the op instance are specified in [`.claude/domain-rules/ops-design.md`](../../.claude/domain-rules/ops-design.md).
- Bind `elem_bytes` from whichever dtype source exists at the call site (§4.4.5): use `self.dtype.itemsize` when `eval_roofline()` runs at `__init__` (fixed-rank — no tensor yet), and `self.<first_input>.dtype.itemsize` when it runs in `forward()` (arbitrary-rank — the tensor is bound).
- If `vars:` is present, emit one assignment per entry in YAML declaration order: `<name> = <vars[name]>`, copying the expression string verbatim. Later entries may reference earlier locals.
- If `vars:` is absent and `shape` is fixed-rank, emit assignments from the `shape` declaration (tuple-unpack `self.x.shape`, or read `self.<dim>` if the Op stored dims at `__init__`).

**Block 2 — arithmetic.** Return `(<flops>, <bytes>)` with both expression strings copied verbatim. They reference only Block 1 locals + `elem_bytes` + arithmetic-layer helpers (§4.4.4).

Do **not** inline a vars expression into the arithmetic expression (e.g. `return (4 * product(x.shape[:dim]) * x.shape[dim], ...)`). That collapses the two layers and violates arithmetic-layer restrictions.

Reduction dim handling in the vars layer follows the manifest `shape_rules` contract: validate range → normalize `% x.ndim` → reject duplicate axes for sequence dims. A roofline expression must not silently normalize an invalid axis.

Example — arbitrary-rank (explicit `vars`):

```python
def eval_roofline(self) -> tuple[int, int]:
    # Block 1: vars layer
    x = self.x
    dim = self.dim
    elem_bytes = self.x.dtype.itemsize
    M = product(x.shape[:dim])
    N = x.shape[dim]
    # Block 2: arithmetic layer
    return (
        4 * M * N,
        (2 * M * N + N) * elem_bytes,
    )
```

Fixed-rank form: see the template in §4.4.1.

Any `Name` node not resolvable to a Block 1 local, `elem_bytes`, or an arithmetic-layer helper causes codegen to raise. Any forbidden AST node (`Attribute`, `Subscript`, `Comprehension`, `Lambda`, …) in the arithmetic layer also causes codegen to raise. These are the enforcement of the "authoritative gate" responsibility.

#### 4.4.4 Namespace

Codegen knows how to bind the following names when generating the method body. This is the single source of truth for what an inline formula may reference.

**vars layer**

| Bucket    | Names                                                                                                                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tensors   | All `signature.inputs` names, exposed with a `.shape` accessor                                                                               |
| Params    | All `signature.params` names                                                                                                                 |
| Constants | `elem_bytes`                                                                                                                                 |
| Helpers   | `product`, `isinstance`, `len`, `set`, `tuple`, `list`, `range`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `abs`, `log2`, `ceil`, `floor` |

**arithmetic layer**

| Bucket    | Names                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Variables | Resolved vars from the vars layer |
| Constants | `elem_bytes`                      |
| Helpers   | `ceil`, `floor`, `log2`           |

Adding or removing a helper = edit codegen's binding table. No parallel update in validator or anywhere else is required. If a formula references a name not in this table, codegen fails; the manifest does not land.

#### 4.4.5 Runtime Timing

Generated `eval_roofline()` follows shape-inference timing: resolve variables at the first moment they are known, cache the result, do not recompute for identical inputs.

| Op category    | Variables known at                                                 | `eval_roofline()` behavior                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fixed-rank     | `__init__` (all dimensions provided)                               | Called once during init; result may be stored on the Op.              |
| Arbitrary-rank | `__init__` for `static_dims`; `forward` for remaining dynamic dims | Called in `forward()` when dynamic vars are resolved; cache by input. |

Non-runtime consumers must instantiate the Op (or read pre-computed `(flops, bytes)` from benchmark output). No manifest-level roofline evaluator exists; every value flows through `op.eval_roofline()`.

#### 4.4.6 Evaluator Surface Boundary

Roofline expressions live in exactly one place at runtime: the plain Python body that codegen emits into each op's `eval_roofline()`. No standalone roofline evaluator exists.

| Surface                           | Scope | Interprets roofline expressions? |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| Op-local AST evaluator            | —     | **REJECTED** — must not be built |
| Manifest-level roofline evaluator | —     | **REJECTED** — must not be built |

Rules:

- No `tileops.manifest.eval_roofline()` / `resolve_roofline_vars()` helper that evaluates roofline expressions exists. Any consumer wanting `(flops, bytes)` either calls `op.eval_roofline()` on an Op instance or reads pre-computed values from benchmark output.
- Generated `eval_roofline()` must not parse, AST-analyze, or safe-eval its own formula strings. Codegen does the name/form check at generation time (§4.4.3 / §4.4.4) and then copies validated expressions into plain Python.
- If a formula is too complex for inline arithmetic (conditionals, shape traversal, data-dependent logic), switch the entry to `func` mode (§2.2). Do not extend inline formulas into a mini-language.

### 4.5 Bytes Audit (NCU)

`scripts/validate_roofline_bytes.py` compares each op's `bytes` formula against hardware counters. It exists because the metric's objectivity rests on `bytes` being the true minimum traffic, and an overestimating formula inflates every efficiency reading in a way neither review nor the physics check is guaranteed to catch.

Method, per audited op:

1. Pick workloads covering the formula's branch signatures (dtype combos, optional-input presence, backend labels), from the manifest's real workloads — never scaled-up shapes, which can cross kernel-selection thresholds and audit an implementation the benchmark does not run.
1. Run `forward()` once (input-inferred ops bind their roofline variables there), then read `op.eval_roofline()`.
1. Measure a second `forward()` under Nsight Compute with cache control on, summing `dram__bytes_read.sum + dram__bytes_write.sum` over the call's kernels.

| Verdict | Condition                            | Reading                                                                                                                             |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FAIL    | `measured < formula × (1 − ε)`       | Only a formula overestimate produces it: sector granularity, write-allocate, ECC, and replay cache-flushing all push `measured` up. |
| WARN    | `measured > formula × 1.5`           | Multi-pass implementation or replay inflation; informational.                                                                       |
| ERROR   | missing metric or empty kernel range | A broken audit, never a verdict.                                                                                                    |

Runs on demand (profiling permissions, replay cost) — after a manifest `roofline` edit, and as the mandatory check for ops exempt from the structural oracle (data-dependent traffic the oracle cannot count).

### 4.6 Structural Oracle (tests)

A CI test recomputes each audited `bytes` value from an independent path — the sizes of the tensors the workload actually binds (each distinct input storage once, each output once) — and requires equality with `eval_roofline()`. The formula and the oracle share only the minimum-traffic definition, so a coefficient slip, a missed output, a wrong `elem_bytes`, or a broadcast counted at the wrong shape breaks the equality.

Ops whose traffic depends on tensor *content* (gather-style indexing) are exempt by explicit list and covered by §4.5 instead. Coverage is golden workloads per op, not randomized sweeps.

A completeness test keeps the classification total: every implemented op is audited, exempt with a reason, or on an explicit pending list to burn down. An op added to the manifest fails the test until it is classified.

## 5. Reference

### 5.1 NPU Profile

Hardware parameters use theoretical values with calibration factors from one-time microbenchmark measurements. A bandwidth calibration is the **envelope** over the measured access mixes (copy, Triad, pure read, pure write): a ceiling some legitimate mix can exceed is not a ceiling, and readings above 100% must stay reserved for formula errors; each mix's own measured fraction is kept as data (`calibration_mixes`), so a future per-mix ceiling reads it instead of re-measuring. YAML files store only measured values; `effective = theoretical × calibration` is computed by `load_profile()`:

```yaml
# src/tileops/perf/profiles/ascend910b1.yaml
hbm:
  theoretical: 1.650000e+12  # bytes/s
  calibration: 0.647322974118  # measured 1-4 GiB STREAM-Triad plateau / estimate
cube:
  fp16:
    theoretical: 3.788800e+14  # FLOPS: 25 cores x 1850 MHz x 16x16x16 MMAD x 2
    calibration: 0.768044158423  # measured 290.997 TFLOPS / derived ceiling
vector: {}  # not yet calibrated; see the file
```

Profiles are stored in `src/tileops/perf/profiles/`. `ascend910b1.yaml` is a copy of `tileops-ascend-harness/hw/ascend910b1.yaml`, the file the harness measures against, and every number in it carries its own provenance comment. Where a datasheet figure was unavailable — 910B1's HBM bus geometry is not in the installed CANN/OPP files — the theoretical value is an explicitly-stated estimate above the measured maximum, not a guess presented as a spec. A section with no measurement behind it is left empty rather than filled in: `resolve_roof` then returns `None` and the consumer leaves the compute ceiling blank.

### 5.2 Benchmark–Roofline Decoupling

Benchmark (M4) produces per-workload records containing raw time and the `(flops, bytes)` from `op.eval_roofline()`. Roofline (M5) is a separate tool that reads those records + device profile to compute efficiency. This separation enables:

- Re-analyzing historical data when device profiles are updated
- Multiple consumers of raw benchmark data (roofline, regression detection, dashboards)
- Benchmark module has no third-party dependencies beyond the project itself

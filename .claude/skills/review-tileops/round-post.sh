# round-post.sh — post-codex hook for the review loop.
#
# Implements Rule 2 (same-path 5-strike monitor): track per-path
# consecutive-blocker streaks across rounds. When any path's streak
# reaches >= 5 consecutive rounds with at least one blocker on it,
# ensure the PR carries the GitHub label "agent-stuck" so a human
# can take a look.
#
# Monitoring-only: this hook MUST NOT modify the round's blockers,
# the unresolved-threads file, the new-review-comments.json file,
# the PR title, or post any comment. Its only side-effects on the
# PR are GitHub label operations (idempotent).
#
# Inputs (env or positional, env wins):
#   RUN_DIR        — review/ root for this loop run.
#   ROUND          — integer round number that just finished.
#   COMMENTS_JSON  — path to round-NN.codex-blockers.json (the post-
#                    codex snapshot of review comments authored by
#                    REVIEWER_LOGIN this round; used as the source of
#                    blocker paths). The pre-codex
#                    round-NN.new-review-comments.json is the WRONG
#                    artifact — it explicitly filters out the reviewer
#                    and contains human comments instead.
#   REPO           — "owner/repo" string for `gh` operations.
#                    Default: yyttt6/TileOPs.
#   PR             — PR number for `gh pr edit`.
#
# Positional fallback: round-post.sh <RUN_DIR> <ROUND> <COMMENTS_JSON> <REPO> <PR>
#
# Optional env (for testing):
#   GH_BIN         — gh executable to use (default: "gh"). Tests can
#                    point this at a stub. If empty or "none", label
#                    operations are skipped entirely (monitor still
#                    updates region-history.json).
#
# Output: exit 0 on success. Logs to stderr; nothing on stdout.

# --- 1. Extract blocker paths from this round's review comments ---
#
# Source-of-truth contract: this round's codex-blockers.json is the
# post-codex snapshot of review comments authored by the reviewer login
# (i.e. comments codex itself just posted as part of this review).
# Entries with severity=blocker (or category=blocker) carry the .path
# the reviewer flagged. We treat any entry whose .severity or .category
# is "blocker" as a blocker. If neither field exists (older format or
# free-form review), every entry counts. Round-post is monitoring-only:
# the only side-effect is the `agent-stuck` label, which is itself
# idempotent and safe to apply early. Over-counting accelerates the
# threshold (i.e. the label may land sooner than a strict-blocker count
# would warrant); it never produces an unsafe action.

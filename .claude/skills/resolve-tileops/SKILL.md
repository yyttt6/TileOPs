name: resolve-tileops
description: Per-round driver of stateful agent-driven review-resolution on a yyttt6/TileOPs PR (developer side). Designed for /loop dynamic mode — re-fires until a terminal action. Outer caller must run preflight.sh once before starting the loop. State persists in `.foundry/runs/{issue-<N> | pr-<PR>}/resolve/`.

## Arguments

| Argument      | Required | Description                      |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `<PR_NUMBER>` | Yes      | TileOPs PR number (e.g. `1133`). |

Resolution work runs in **this agent session** — no external subagent.

## Step 1: Pre-round

```bash
PR=$ARGUMENTS
PRE=$(bash .claude/skills/resolve-tileops/round-pre.sh "$PR") || exit 1
ACTION=$(echo "$PRE" | jq -r .action)
ROUND=$(echo "$PRE" | jq -r .round)
RUN_DIR=$(echo "$PRE" | jq -r .run_dir)
SNAP=$(echo "$PRE" | jq -r .snap_prefix)
MESSAGE=$(echo "$PRE" | jq -r .message)
```

Branch on `ACTION`:

- `terminate-success` / `terminate-diverged` / `terminate-external` /
  `terminate-stalled` — write retrospective (see below), print
  `MESSAGE`, **return without ScheduleWakeup**.
- `idle` — print `MESSAGE`, ScheduleWakeup with `delaySeconds=180`,
  `prompt=/resolve-tileops <PR>`, `reason="PR #<PR> idle — polling"`. Return.
- `continue` — proceed to Step 2.

### Retrospective (terminal actions only)

Write a terse retrospective directly to `$RUN_DIR/retrospective.md` based
on this session's understanding of what happened across the loop's rounds.

Required:

- **Problem** (1–2 lines on core reviewer concerns)
- **Resolution** (`all-addressed` | `partial` | `unresolved`, one line)

Optional (only if substantive):

- **Approach** (1–2 lines on techniques applied)
- **Follow-up** (concrete deferred items, one per line)

Action-oriented; no long prose.

## Step 2: Load context

**Round 1 only** — read into your working context:

- `.claude/skills/resolve-tileops/procedure.md` — triage / fix / reply / resolve threads.
- `.claude/skills/resolve-tileops/criteria.md` — reply formats and hard rules.

Round 2+ rely on session memory.

**Every round** — read this round's inputs:

- `$RUN_DIR/inbox-history/round-NN.md` — this round's inbox guidance,
  if any (only present if `inbox.md` was non-empty when round-pre archived it).
- `$SNAP.new-reviews.json`
- `$SNAP.new-inline-comments.json`
- `$SNAP.unresolved-threads.json`
- `$SNAP.ci.json`
- `$SNAP.auto-resolve.json` — JSON action plan from the stale-bot auto-resolver. `resolve[]` lists threads the classifier *planned* to auto-reply + resolve (known bot, anchored to a stale commit, no non-whitelisted participant anywhere in the thread); per-thread outcomes live under `executed.{resolved, reply_failed, resolve_failed}` so consumers can distinguish a planned-and-completed resolve from a planned-but-failed one. `unknown_bot_like[]` and `$RUN_DIR/round-NN.unknown-bot-like.json` flag bot-like logins missing from `known-bots.json` for human triage. `skip[]` lists threads the resolver intentionally left untouched (humans, mixed-author threads, or bots already at HEAD).

## Step 3: Resolve

Apply `procedure.md`. Inbox guidance for this round (if any) overrides
default behavior where they conflict.

Do NOT post a structured trailer in any PR comment — `round-post.sh`
detects round effects from GitHub state.

## Step 4: Post-round

```bash
POST=$(bash .claude/skills/resolve-tileops/round-post.sh "$PR") || exit 1
PUSHED_SHA=$(echo "$POST" | jq -r .pushed_sha)
THREADS_RESOLVED=$(echo "$POST" | jq -r .threads_resolved)
OPEN_AFTER=$(echo "$POST" | jq -r .open_after)
```

Print: `Round $ROUND done — pushed=$PUSHED_SHA, threads_resolved=$THREADS_RESOLVED, open_after=$OPEN_AFTER.`

## Step 5: Self-schedule (only under /loop)

After a real work round, ScheduleWakeup:

- `prompt`: `/resolve-tileops <PR>`
- `delaySeconds`: `180`
- `reason`: `"PR #<PR> resolve round <ROUND> — pushed=<PUSHED_SHA>"`

Outside `/loop`: skip; just return.

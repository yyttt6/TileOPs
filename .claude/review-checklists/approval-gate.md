Run before approving any PR. Apply each item if its scope matches the diff.

## Tests

- [ ] **Per-case verdict.** Triage every added/modified test case as `keep` / `shrink` / `delete`. Inline only on blockers; clean test PRs stay clean (`criteria.md §3`).

  | Verdict                        | When                                                                         | Inline?     |
  | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
  | `keep — guards <path/dtype>`   | distinct code path or dtype (per `docs/design/testing.md §Test case policy`) | no          |
  | `shrink — fold to <axis>`      | Cartesian expansion; fold to "boundary + one representative interior point"  | **blocker** |
  | `delete — duplicate of <node>` | same-failure-mode duplicate of a kept case                                   | **blocker** |

  Cases the reviewer cannot classify with confidence count as untriaged → **blocker inline** asking the developer for rationale. Every blocker must be resolved (shrink / delete, or downgrade to `keep` with rationale) before APPROVE.

- [ ] **Numerical floor.** Run `python scripts/test_node_delta.py --base upstream/main` (prereq: `upstream` points to yyttt6/TileOPs and is fresh — `git fetch upstream` first). REQUEST_CHANGES with the full node-ID list if existing-file growth > 25% AND any case carries an unresolved `shrink`/`delete` blocker or is untriaged. Absence of an inline is not itself a blocker — silent `keep` is the default.

- [ ] **Critical-path floor.** Never remove the last test on an output-distinguishing input: tile boundary, vectorization alignment, degenerate dimension (size = 1), or a dispatch branch carrying observable behavior. Tests with no output-distinguishing input are removable.

- [ ] **No AC defense.** Reject "AC-N required this matrix" — AC text does not bind the merged suite.

## Scope-specific

- [ ] **Skill edits (`.claude/skills/**`).** Require a tightening pass before APPROVE — condense wording without changing what the skill instructs. Verify: semantics preserved, every step has exactly one valid execution path, no example included unless load-bearing, retained examples reference durable concepts rather than implementation details that age out.
